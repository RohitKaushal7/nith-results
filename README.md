https://nith.netlify.app  
This is a [**Website**](https://nith.netlify.app/) to get your result in **NIT Hamirpur**. Check your full result and find your rank in the Class or College.

## ðŸ˜• Why it doesn't work Now?

- The results portal on the official NITH results websites now has a human verification captcha, making web scrapping not possible / hard.
- The API for results was hosted on Heroku, they discontinued their free tier.

## How it works

Result data for every student is web scraped form the official NITH results college website via a python script which is stored in database and served via API.
